This application is used to store the patient data securely on the blockchain network, where we have 4 entities including patient, doctor, insurance company and chemist. The system focuses on giving the full authority of oneâ€™s medical data securely with the person/patient and giving the person authority to share data only with healthcare organization or insurance company to whom he wants to share. Healthcare Organization can only have access to particular data of patient only if patient gives access and the data is stored in the decentralized network with respect to patient and not with the healthcare organization. The system also focuses on maintaining the expense information with respect to a particular treatment, in order to have a proof of price at what particular medicine or treatment had cost to the patient in an immutable storage. Also Patient can apply for insurance in the applied insurance company from the network itself with the treatment bills and medicals bills associated with their Id.
